# Packing List
To run this project, you will need the following items installed:

Markup :  * MySQL database version 5.5+
          * Tomcat servlet container version 8.5+
          * Java 11 JDK (full development kit)

The project is packaged to be automatically built using the Gradle build system (or an IDE that supports Gradle). The output of the build is a "web application archive" (WAR) file that can be copied into $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps for deployment.
